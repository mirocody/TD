Elements Defense

Overview

Engine: Unity3D

Platform: iOS

Game Concept

The purpose of this game is to build your own towers to protect yourself from being attacked by the creeps. There are five types of basic towers, five types of combined towers, and five types of creeps correspondingly, each type of basic tower has three levels and each one does different damage on these creeps. Thus, the game requires the player to come up with an optimal way to plan and build their towers on different locations in order to kill the creeps and survive from the fight. What makes our game different than other tower defense games is that we introduce Chinese element concept to our game. We can combine different elements with towers to gain new towers, making this game more interactive among towers. The player could take advantage of combining towers to get extra attack power, instead of separating each tower and using them as a single, independent tower.

Target Audience

This game is designed for people who like to play games with strategies, similar games including PvZ. Our game introduces traditional Chinese elements into the fight, which provides more fun to the players.  Moreover, as the towers and creeps would accumulate and get stronger until the end of the game, our game would be more exciting and attractive. 

There is another feature of our game: different from other tower defense game, you cannot only build tower and watch the game, you also need to decide which enemy you should attach first. For example, when there is a boss or an enemy with low hp but is going to leave, you should kill him first. We also have box object, we call it gift— you could attack it and after destroying it, you might get gold, tower, or even an element card. Also you get a new empty tower spot to build your new tower. 


The best fit device of this game is on iPad, since the player could easily build defense towers by touching the screen and has a larger view of the whole game scene. Also, our character design is pretty adorable, which attracts people to play our game and is also friendly to kids.

Backstory

Once upon time, there was a wonderful land with 5 main elements: fire, earth, metal, water and wood. Mutually reinforced and neutralized with each other, they composed a lively world. The land is divided into five large tribes: Volcan, Terra, Meta, Aqua and Lign. Each tribe master their relevant power. They cooperate and also compete. 

The Volcans are passionate. They can ignite the flame and burn the wood into earth. The Terras are really good at hiding and have great speed pass through the earth. But they are always easily found by sweet-tempered Ligns, who have multiple brides and use them as weapons. The Metas are the toughest people on the land, they can break all wooden fortifications using their strong bodies. They are good friends with the Aquas with some unknown reason. The Aquas are a group of lively elfin. They are good at healing, especially give birth to the wood. Though they are little man, they’re good attackers in the war to slow the speed of the enemies and put out the fire. All the five tribes lived happily and harmoniously on the land.

One day, however, lots of unexpected creepers arrived on the land continuously through a mysterious entrance and destroyed the peace. The cities are ruined, the buildings are collapsed and the persons are homeless. Leaders of each tribe met at the headquarters and found that the only way to save the land is to gather the power of their tribes together and create a seal to close the mysterious entrance.

In order to protect the scientists in the headquarters, the super hero Bang, who has the power of the five tribes. No one knows where Bang came from. It is said that Bang born in an explosion in the early period of land’s history. Bang need to build towers on the ways leading to the headquarters to defend the attack from creepers. All the hopes to save the beautiful land now rest on Bang. Will Bang success?!

Objects 

There will be six objects in our game, including  basic tower, combined tower, element creep, element card, gift box and gold.

Basic Tower

There are five types of them, including fire, earth, metal, water and wood. The player is able to upgrade the the tower’s level. The attack power of the tower will increase as the player upgrade the tower’s level. The player can upgrade the towers in order to kill more creeps by spending the collected gold. Different types of towers will have different impact on a certain type of creeps. For example, the fire tower will do more damage on the metal creep than the earth tower will do.

Combined Tower

After being upgraded to level 3, each basic tower could combine with a certain element card to evolve to the combined tower; each combined tower has a new attack feature, more than the previous basic attack power. The combining rule and their new attack features are:

Transfer enemies:
Fire element combines with Earth tower
Transfer all enemies located in the range to the starting point

Slow enemies:
Metal element combines with Water tower
Slow down all enemies that are located in the range

Copy towers:
Water element combines with Wood tower	
Copy the most expensive tower nearby and create a same one to an empty tower spot

Faint enemies:
Earth element combines with Metal tower
Cause every passing by enemy faint, enemy will stop walking

Attack a line’s enemies
Wood element combines with Fire tower
Bullets from this tower can attack all enemies that are passing by that line

Element Card

There are two ways to collect Element Card: Kill both of the first five waves or attack the gift box. The gift box has a small chance to drop an element card. These element cards could be used to combine with top level basic towers to get a combined tower with more attack features.

Gift Box

Gift box could be attacked and destroyed. After being destroyed, it could drop you gold, a tower or an element card. Most importantly, you could get a new tower spot to build towers.

Creeps

There are also five types of creeps, including  fire, earth, metal, water and wood. For the first five wave creeps, there is a box who takes an element card for player to collect. The last five waves creeps are extremely strong and need player pay attention to take care of.

Gold

The need for building and upgrading any towers. Player can collect the gold by killing creeps or by some special event in the game. For example, the gold will be given to the player every 2 minutes. 


Play rules

The goal of the game is to build your element tower to protect yourself. There are 10 waves of creeps that would appear in order and each wave would be stronger than the earlier one. 

Each player would have 10 hp. The creep would walk along the fixed route and be attacked by the tower you build. Each creep has not been killed at the end of the route would reduce your hp by 1 and the creep would still exist in the following waves. 

Thus, to survive in the game you have to build your powerful tower with strategy. There are five elements in the game: fire, earth, metal, water and wood. Each element has overcoming and generating interaction with other elements. For example, ‘fire’ tower would make 200% damage to metal creep while it would only make 50% damage to water creep. The creeps in different waves are with different elements; so you should make decision which element tower you should build; you also need to decide the location where to build the tower to get highest efficiency. 
Creeps

Level 1st: A wave of metal creeps with a metal Boss
Level 2nd: A wave of wood creeps with a wood Boss
Level 3rd: A wave of water creeps with a water Boss
Level 4th: A wave of fire creeps with a fire Boss
Level 5th: A wave of earth creeps with an earth Boss
Level 1st: A wave of strong metal creeps 
Level 2nd: A wave of strong wood creeps
Level 3rd: A wave of strong water creeps
Level 4th: A wave of strong fire creeps
Level 5th: A wave of strong earth creeps


Optional development

The tower could eventually evolve to more-elements-combined tower, the basic one-floor tower is what we plan to implement, if the project goes well and we have extra time. 

Moreover, we could design new mode to play: challenge mode. Challenge mode has infinite waves of creeps and the goal is surviving as long as possible.
