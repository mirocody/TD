Game Concept

The purpose of this game is to build your own towers to protect yourself from being attacked by the creeps. There are five types of towers and five types of creeps correspondingly, each type of tower does different damage on different types of creeps. Thus, the game requires the player to come up with an optimal way to plan and build their towers on different locations in order to kill the creeps and survive from the fight.

Target Audience

This game is designed for people who like to play games with strategies, similar games including PvZ. Our game introduces traditional Chinese elements into the fight, which provides more fun to the players. Moreover, as the towers and creeps would accumulate until the end of the game, our game would be more exciting and attractive. 

The best fit device of this game is on iPad, since the player could easily build defense towers by touching the screen and has a larger view of the whole game scene. Also, our character design is pretty adorable, which attracts people to play our game and is also friendly to kids.

Genres
Tower Defense, Problem-solving. Similar games are Kingdom Rush, Plants vs. Zombies, etc.


Backstory

Once upon time, there was a wonderful land with 5 main elements: fire, earth, metal, water and wood. Mutually reinforced and neutralized with each other, they composed a lively world. The land is divided into five large tribes: Volcan, Terra, Meta, Aqua and Lign. Each tribe master their relevant power. They cooperate and also compete. 

The Volcans are passionate. They can ignite the flame and burn the wood into earth. The Terras are really good at hiding and have great speed pass through the earth. But they are always easily found by sweet-tempered Ligns, who have multiple brides and use them as weapons. The Metas are the toughest people on the land, they can break all wooden fortifications using their strong bodies. They are good friends with the Aquas with some unknown reason. The Aquas are a group of lively elfin. They are good at healing, especially give birth to the wood. Though they are little man, they’re good attackers in the war to slow the speed of the enemies and put out the fire. All the five tribes lived happily and harmoniously on the land.

One day, however, lots of unexpected creepers arrived on the land continuously through a mysterious entrance and destroyed the peace. The cities are ruined, the buildings are collapsed and the persons are homeless. Leaders of each tribe met at the headquarters and found that the only way to save the land is to gather the power of their tribes together and create a seal to close the mysterious entrance.

In order to protect the scientists in the headquarters, the super hero Bang, who has the power of the five tribes. No one knows where Bang came from. It is said that Bang born in an explosion in the early period of land’s history. Bang need to build towers on the ways leading to the headquarters to defend the attack from creepers. All the hopes to save the beautiful land now rest on Bang. Will Bang success?!


Objects 
There will be four objects in our game, including  element towers, element creeps, gold, and the player.

Tower

There are five type of them, including fire, earth, metal, water and wood. The player are able to upgrade the the tower’s level. The power of the tower’s attack will increase as player upgrade the tower’s level. The player can upgrade the towers in order to kill more creeps by spending gold. Different type of the tower will have different impact on a certain type of creeps. For example, the fire tower will do more damage on the metal creep than the earth tower will do.

Creeps

There are also five types of creeps, including  fire, earth, metal, water and wood. Each type of the creeps have their own strength and weakness. For example, the wood creeps will have better defence power, and the fire ones will be able to do more harm on the player. The water creeps will be able to move faster than others. The earth creeps move slower than others but can do more harm. The metal move faster but do less harm than others.

Gold

The need for building and upgrading any towers. Player can collect the gold by killing creeps or by some special event in the game. For example, the gold will be given to the player every 2 minutes. 




Player

There is also a character named Bang that you could control to build the tower. Bang could move regardless obstacles. Also, Bang would not be attacked by the creeps.


Play rules

The goal of the game is to build your element tower to protect yourself. There are 10 waves of creeps that would appear in order and each wave would be stronger than the earlier one. 

Each player would have 50 hp. The creep would walk along the fixed route and be attacked by the tower you build. Each creep has not been killed at the end of the route would reduce your hp by 1 and the creep would still exist in the following waves. 

Thus, to survive in the game you have to build your powerful tower with strategy. There are five elements in the game: fire, earth, metal, water and wood. Each element has overcoming and generating interaction with other elements. For example, ‘fire’ tower would make 200% damage to metal creep while it would only make 50% damage to water creep. The creeps in different waves are with different elements; so you should make decision which element tower you should build; you also need to decide the location where to build the tower to get highest efficiency. 

You need to earn gold to build tower. There are two methods to earn gold: 1. at the end of each wave the system would conclude how many creeps have been killed and decide how much gold you could earn. The more creeps have been killed, the more gold you would earn; 2. you would also earn gold by killing each creep. 

Level

Level 1st: A wave of metal creeps
Level 2nd: A wave of wood creeps
Level 3rd: A wave of water creeps
Level 4th: A wave of fire creeps
Level 5th: A wave of earth creeps
Level 6th: A wave of fire creeps and earth creeps
Level 7th: A wave of water creeps and wood creeps
Level 8th: A wave of wood creeps and fire creeps
Level 9th: A wave of earth creeps and metal creeps
Level 10th: Combination of all kinds of creeps

Moreover, the hp and moving speed would increase for each new wave


Optional development

The tower could eventually evolve to three-floor tower, the basic one-floor tower is what we plan to implement, if the project goes well and we have extra time, the second and third floor would come true.
 
Unlike the first floor, the second floor is to storage power, player double tap the tower to release the power, which is enhanced attack to all creeps within its attack range (it takes perhaps 15-20s to recharge the power, the attack may lasts 2-3s). Each type of tower has its unique enhanced attack, for example the water-type tower could generate flood within its range, while earth-type tower could cause ground collapse.
 
The magic third floor is able to connect other tower(s) to produce even more diverse and powerful attack, once two towers have power recharged, user can draw a line to connect two towers, say water-type and earth-type tower, then mud-rock flow will attack the creeps in the range. It can extend to connect three (by drawing triangle), four and up to five towers at a time. As attack range, the connection also has its range; it depends on the tower level and where you put the tower (the higher, the farther it can reach, image that it works as radio station).
 
Another thing in our optional list is to introduce the hero, remember we have five tribes in our game; player can pick one of the leaders of tribes as hero, each hero have unique weapons and skill, player can move the hero, the hero will automatically attack the creeps in the range. We have hero, what about boss? We can introduce different boss across a range of increasingly complex levels.
 
We develop the game from a simple map, and then evolve to various maps; finally we combine all maps as a whole.
